## - How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting users needs from what they are asking for to what is needed on the development side is often difficult and seems like people are speaking different languages. User Stories is a great way to do this. It takes what the customer is asking and breaks it down into development size chunks. It allows you to take a overview of what the client is needing and prioritizing it / ordering it by most necessary.

## - How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The biggest thing I look forward to implementing in my own development is the concept of working with a small team to solve problems. Using things such as pair programming and the daily standup to address these needs will help facilitate solving problems and moving forward with development.

## - What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member, involves things such as being clear on your abilities, and stuggles. Stepping up to help others in areas that you are comfortable with. Sharing your input on things such as user stories and creating things such as burn down charts. Basically being able to help others with what you excel at, and at the same time sharing your struggles so others can help you.
